Part 1: Creating the Webpage
Create a New Repository:

On GitHub, create a new repository named Form-Validation.
Initialize this repository with a README.md file.
Clone your new repository to your local machine.
Develop the Webpage:

Create an index.html file in your repository.
Design two forms. One with HTML5 validation and one with JS validation.
HTML5 Validation (updated): Design a form in the webpage that includes
A text input field for a username with JavaScript HTML 5 validation for length (minimum 5 characters).
An email input field with HTML5 validation
Additional input fields of your choice with HTML5 validation (e.g., password, number range, required checkboxes).
A submit button.
Include CSS for :valid and :invalid inputs
JavaScript: Add the following validation to your form:
Another text input field for a username with JavaScript validation for length (minimum 5 characters).
Include comments in the code explaining each form element, its validation purpose, and how the JavaScript validation works.
Part 3: Deployment and Submission
Deploy Your Webpage Using GitHub Pages:

In your repository settings on GitHub, navigate to the GitHub Pages section.
Select the branch you want to deploy (usually main).
Save the settings and wait for GitHub to deploy your site.
Once deployed, GitHub will provide a URL where your site is live.
